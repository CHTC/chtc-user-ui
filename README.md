## Docker

This is the easiest, if you have something quick I would do this.

Run the command below and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

```shell
docker compose up
```

## PNPM

[Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) and run `pnpm install` (only need to do it once).

Run `pnpm run dev`.

This will be the fastest if you aren't on linux.
